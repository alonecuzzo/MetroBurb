//1. closest stop service really, since that's all it's getting for us - doesn't matter where it comes from
//2. the db stop service can handle all interfacing with the stops, we'll still need to convert them into stops, but this should be returning a stop model objcect
//3. or do we have a stop service that allows us to do what we want to the stops?

//what are things that we want to do with the stops
//get stop by id
//get stop by location
//get stop by name

struct Location {
    let latitude: Double
    let longitude: Double
}

//there's a trip
struct Trip {
    let tripID: String
    let tripHeadSign: String //"Penn Station", "Bablyon" etc
    let directionID: Int //1 means going out, 0 means coming in
}

//1. can we get all of the trips for a stop
//2. can we then get all of the trips at a stop with a departure time within an hour
//3. then out of those just show the arrival times w/ the matching stopid

//we want to select a stop, and see the trips that terminate at the other stop

//going to be async and possibly failable - that's why we have observables instead of just returning values
